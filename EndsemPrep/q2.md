Question: Client–Server Program for Seller and Payment Gateway

Develop a client–server application that simulates transactions between multiple sellers and a payment gateway, as per the following specifications:

1. Sellers and Transactions

Implement a minimum of two sellers.

Each seller should perform at least two or more transactions.



2. Paillier Encryption for Transaction Amounts

Each transaction amount must be encrypted using the Paillier encryption algorithm.

The encrypted amounts should be added homomorphically to compute the total encrypted transaction amount for each seller.

The total should then be decrypted to obtain the total decrypted amount.



3. Transaction Summary

Maintain a transaction summary for all sellers containing the following details:

Seller Name

Individual Transaction Amounts

Encrypted Transaction Amounts

Decrypted Transaction Amounts

Total Encrypted Transaction Amount

Total Decrypted Transaction Amount

Digital Signature Status

Signature Verification Result




4. Digital Signature and Verification

Generate and verify digital signatures using the RSA algorithm.

Apply SHA-256 hashing on the entire transaction summary before signing and verifying.



5. Output Requirements

Display the complete transaction summary for all sellers, including encryption, decryption, total amount computation, and signature verification results.
